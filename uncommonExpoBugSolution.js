Several approaches can resolve this elusive linking issue:

**1. Clean and Rebuild:**

   - Run `expo prebuild --clean` to thoroughly clean the build cache and re-generate all necessary files.
   - Then run `expo start` to start your app again.

**2. Verify Native Module Integration:**

   - Certain libraries might require specific configurations for native module integration. Check your chosen library's documentation, particularly if it involves native components or platform-specific modules.
   - If the library has an Expo-specific setup or instructions, ensure you've followed them precisely.   

**3. Manual Linking (As a last resort):**

   - In rare cases, you may need to manually link the library's native modules. This usually involves using platform-specific build tools. Refer to the library's documentation for specific instructions.  Manual linking should be avoided if possible, as it's beyond the scope of Expo's managed workflow.

**4. Check Package.json and EAS Build:**

   - Carefully verify that the packages listed in your `package.json` accurately reflect the dependencies your application needs.
   - If you are using EAS Build, examine your configuration to make sure it's handling your dependencies correctly and that appropriate build settings are in place. 

**5. Update Expo CLI:**

   - Ensure you're using the latest version of the Expo CLI by running `npm update -g expo-cli`. An outdated CLI might have compatibility issues with certain libraries.

**Example showing a successful fix:**

```javascript
// uncommonExpoBugSolution.js
expo prebuild --clean; expo start;
```
