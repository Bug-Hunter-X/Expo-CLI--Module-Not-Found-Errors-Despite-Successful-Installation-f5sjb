This error occurs when you try to use a feature from a library that is not correctly installed or linked in your Expo project.  It often manifests as an error message indicating a module or component cannot be found, even though you've imported it correctly. For example, you might see errors like `'moduleName' is not defined` or similar, even if you've installed the package using `expo install moduleName`. This can happen even if `expo prebuild` or similar commands seem to succeed without errors.
